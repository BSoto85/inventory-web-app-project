# Inventory Web App Project
## _Treats by Brenda_

This application is for use in a bakery, allowing employees to input baked goods with corresponding information.

### Install
- Fork and clone repository

### Features
__A user can:__
- Use a form to create a baked good.
  - Choose the type of baked good from a drop-down menu.
  - Input a name for the baked good.
  - Choose a flavor from a drop-down menu.
  - Add a price in cents.
  - Choose whether or not a good is in stock.
  - Input the amount of calories.
  - Check off any allergens present in the baked good.
- Reset the form by clicling the reset button.
- Remove any baked goods created by clicking the remove button for that good.
- Change whether the item is in or out of stock by clicking the In/Out of Stock button.

### Stretch Goals

A couple of features were implemented as part of stretch goals:

1. In/Out of Stock button changes wording and background color when clicked.
1. Transition used to ease in/out of card over 0.3 seconds, getting bigger when the mouse hovers over it, and back to normal size when the mouse moves away. The background color also changes when the mouse hovers over the card.
1. Calories and allergens show on mouse-on, and disappear on mouse-off.
